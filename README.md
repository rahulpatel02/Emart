# Emart

Emart is a robust and user-friendly platform designed to provide customers with a seamless online shopping experience. With a wide range of products, secure payment options, and efficient order processing, our application aims to meet the needs of modern shoppers and drive business growth.
Created separate User and Admin modules with different functionalities and user interfaces.

User Module:

Product Purchase:

Users can browse the product catalog, view product details, and add desired products to their shopping cart.
Upon checkout, users can review the cart contents, update quantities, and proceed to the payment stage.

Shopping Cart Management:

Users can easily add or remove products from their shopping cart, update quantities, and review the total order value before proceeding to checkout.
The shopping cart functionality allows for a seamless and flexible shopping experience.

Order Cancellation:

In case a user wishes to cancel an order, we provide an option to cancel the order before it is shipped.
Users can access their order history, select the relevant order, and initiate the cancellation process.

Product Filtering by Category:

To enhance the shopping experience, users can filter products by category.
Users can navigate to specific categories or use filters to narrow down their product search.

Razorpay Payment Integration:

We have integrated Razorpay as the payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions.
Users can choose to pay using credit cards, debit cards, or UPI.
The application integrates with Razorpay's APIs and SDKs to securely process payments and handle transaction details.

Admin Module:

Admin Dashboard:
We have created an admin dashboard with appropriate access controls and privileges. The dashboard provides an interface for the admin to manage various aspects of the e-commerce platform, including product management.

Product Management:

Within the admin dashboard, the admin can access a product management section. This section allows the admin to add, edit, and delete products from the product catalog and view number of users and orders.
